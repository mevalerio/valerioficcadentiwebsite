summary: "Analyzing the effects of trader backgrounds in a semi-closed simulated stock market."
abstract: |
  Presented at EURO2018, hosted by the University of Valencia from July 8-11, 2018, this work explores the influence of cultural and academic backgrounds on trading strategies and investment decisions in a semi-closed simulated stock market. The project was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Gurjeet Dhesi, Dr. Mohammad Emambocus, Dr. Muhammad Bilal Shakeel, and Dr. Babar Syed.

  An online trading environment was developed to simulate a semi-closed stock market, integrating an endogenous price generation system, news processes, and stock allocation mechanisms. This setup allowed the study of user interactions under order imbalance scenarios. The simulation captured strategic responses of traders with diverse educational and professional experiences, examining their reactions to random news and their ability to interpret market signals rationally.

  The simulated environment collected user background information (e.g., field of study or job position) during registration, enabling detailed analysis of strategies in response to price dynamics and news events. This experiment provided valuable insights into how different backgrounds influence financial decisions in a structured market context.

summary: "An innovative approach to soccer rankings integrating statistical methods for balanced team performance evaluation."
abstract: |
  The presentation introduced an innovative approach to soccer rankings, developed in collaboration with Dr Raffaele Mattera and Prof Roy Cerqueti. The study incorporates multiple performance variables, including scored and conceded goals, alongside traditional win-draw-loss metrics.

  Using Kendall correlations and radar charts, the analysis normalised and visualised team performances. These radar chart areas were transformed into Kendall tau target values, which were subsequently used to construct alternative rankings that better reflect overall team performance. This methodology addresses biases in traditional ranking systems, ensuring more balanced evaluations of offensive and defensive capabilities. The application to the Italian Serie A demonstrated the efficacy of this computational framework for creating fairer and more detailed rankings.

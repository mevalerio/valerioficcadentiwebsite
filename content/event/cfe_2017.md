summary: "Investigating the complexity of US Presidential speeches through computational methods."
abstract: |
  This study explores the rhetorical dynamics of a large collection of United States Presidentsâ€™ speeches, treating them as complex systems and analyzing them through rank-size laws. Words in each speech are ranked by frequency, and best-fit procedures with Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot laws are applied to 951 speeches individually. This analysis offers insights into how 45 United States Presidents, from George Washington (April 30, 1789) to Donald Trump (February 28, 2017), delivered political messages.

  The findings reveal significant regularities not only within individual speeches but also across different ones, highlighting patterns in political and linguistic strategies. The dataset itself represents a key contribution of this work: using a web scraping routine on the Miller Center website, 978 speeches were initially collected. After preprocessing, the dataset was refined to 951 speeches, with word frequencies stored and analyzed.

    Presented the paper "Complexity of United States of America Presidential Speeches" at the joint conference CFE-CMStatistics 2017. The study analyzed rhetorical patterns in US Presidential speeches using computational methods, leveraging rank-size laws and statistical models such as Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot to explore word frequency distributions across 951 speeches.

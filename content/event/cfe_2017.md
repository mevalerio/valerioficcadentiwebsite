summary: "Investigating the complexity of US Presidential speeches through computational methods."
abstract: |
  The presentation explored the rhetorical dynamics of a collection of US Presidential speeches, treating them as complex systems and analysing them through rank-size laws.

  The study utilised the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot models to word frequencies in 951 speeches, spanning from George Washington to Donald Trump. The dataset was constructed through web scraping from the Miller Center website and refined with pre-processing steps to enhance text accuracy.

  The findings revealed significant regularities in individual speeches and across different historical periods, offering insights into the continuity and variations in presidential linguistic strategies in response to political and social contexts.

    Presented the paper "Complexity of United States of America Presidential Speeches" at the joint conference CFE-CMStatistics 2017. The study analyzed rhetorical patterns in US Presidential speeches using computational methods, leveraging rank-size laws and statistical models such as Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot to explore word frequency distributions across 951 speeches.

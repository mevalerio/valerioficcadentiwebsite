summary: "Assessing the economic impact of earthquakes using rank-size analysis."
abstract: |
  The presentation introduced a methodology for quantifying the economic costs of earthquakes in Italy between January 2016 and January 2017. Using the Zipf-Mandelbrot Law and other functions, the study developed economic cost indicators and examined the correlation between earthquake magnitude and resulting damage. Insights were also provided on how infrastructure resilience mitigates the economic impact of seismic events.

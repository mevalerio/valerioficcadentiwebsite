summary: "An exploration of the structural patterns in US Presidential speeches."
abstract: |
  This talk investigates the structure of US Presidential speeches, focusing on underlying linguistic and thematic patterns that characterize presidential communication over time.

  The presentation was part of the COST Action project titled "Analysing the dynamics of information and knowledge landscapes." It examined the rhetorical structure of US Presidential speeches using text analysis techniques to explore informational and cognitive dynamics within the speeches.
  
  The work analyzed how US presidents structured their political messages over time, leveraging word frequency and rank-size laws to study rhetorical dynamics. Quantitative models identified recurring linguistic patterns and strategies, offering insights into the coherence and evolution of presidential language across historical periods and political contexts.

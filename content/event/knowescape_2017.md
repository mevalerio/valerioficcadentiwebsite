summary: "Exploring the structure of the US presidential speeches"
abstract: |
  The presentation focused on the structure of US Presidential speeches, examining underlying linguistic and thematic patterns that characterise presidential communication over time.

  This study was part of the COST Action project titled "Analysing the dynamics of information and knowledge landscapes." It investigated the rhetorical structure of US Presidential speeches using text analysis techniques to explore informational and cognitive dynamics within the speeches.

  The analysis considered how US presidents structured their political messages over time, utilising word frequency and rank-size laws to study rhetorical dynamics. Quantitative models were applied to identify recurring linguistic patterns and strategies, offering insights into the coherence and evolution of presidential language across historical periods and political contexts.

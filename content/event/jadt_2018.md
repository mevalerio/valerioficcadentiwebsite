summary: "Exploring the complexity and clustering patterns in US Presidential speeches through text mining and network analysis."
abstract: |
  Presented at JADT 2018, held at the University of Tor Vergata from June 12-15, 2018, this work explores the complexity and interconnections within US Presidential speeches. In collaboration with Prof. Roy Cerqueti and Prof. Marcel Ausloos, the study analyzes 951 speeches by 45 presidents, from George Washington to Donald Trump.

  Using text mining and network analysis techniques, we isolated a set of significant economic terms and applied cosine similarity to identify connections between speeches. The results reveal a network structure with a core of interrelated speeches sharing a common economic vocabulary, and a periphery of more isolated addresses. Speeches delivered during economic crises tend to cluster together, characterized by a specific shared vocabulary, distinct from those given in stable periods.

    Presented the paper "Complexity and Clustering of the US President Speeches" at JADT 2018, held at the University of Tor Vergata, Rome. In collaboration with Prof. Roy Cerqueti and Prof. Marcel Ausloos, this study used text mining and network analysis to examine the complexity and interconnections in US Presidential speeches. The analysis identified a network core of speeches with shared economic language and a periphery of isolated addresses, offering insights into linguistic patterns during economic crises versus stable periods.

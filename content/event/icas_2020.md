summary: "Analyzing the application of Benford's law to S&P500 market data."
abstract: |
  The presentation focused on the application of Benford's Law to financial time series data, specifically the S&P500 daily closing values and corresponding log-returns. The study, conducted in collaboration with Prof Marcel Ausloos and Dr Gurjeet Dhesi, analysed deviations from Benford's Law to detect anomalies in financial data.

  The results of a test designed to determine whether Brownian motion generates Benford-compliant financial data were also presented. The findings provided a valuable framework for identifying potential irregularities or manipulations in market values, contributing to the broader understanding of financial market dynamics.

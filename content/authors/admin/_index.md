## About Me

Hi there! I am Valerio Ficcadenti ‚Äî welcome to my corner of the web!

I teach research methods, working with around 400 students each year as they approach the culmination of their academic journey. Together, we explore socio-economic phenomena through fascinating datasets, fostering curiosity in business and management science.

My journey spans academia, industry, and local governance, where I have learned that even small decisions can make a big difference.

I am especially proud to have studied Informatics at [Technical Industrial Institute "G. and M. Montani"](https://www.istitutomontani.edu.it/web/storia/), a place that shaped me and introduced me to lifelong friends.

Outside work, you‚Äôll find me cycling üö¥üèΩ, kickboxing ü•ä (black belt!), diving into geopolitical news üìù, or battling it out in board games üé≤ like Catan.

summary: "A study on the relationship between pandemic-induced anxiety and trust in global financial markets."
abstract: |
  The presentation explored the relationship between pandemic-induced anxiety and trust in global financial markets. Using Google Trends data as a proxy for population anxiety, optimism and pessimism indicators were developed to analyse market reactions. The study found a significant correlation between increased COVID-19-related searches and declining trust in financial markets, with notable differences based on national lockdown stringency.

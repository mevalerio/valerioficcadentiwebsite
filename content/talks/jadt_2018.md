summary: "Exploring the complexity and clustering patterns in US Presidential speeches through text mining and network analysis."
abstract: |
  The presentation examined the complexity and clustering in US Presidential speeches, analysing 951 speeches from 45 presidents, ranging from George Washington to Donald Trump.

  Rank-size laws were applied to the speeches, and the parameters obtained from the best fit were used to perform k-means clustering to identify patterns and group speeches by president. Using these methods, the analysis provided insights into how speeches clustered based on rhetorical and thematic features.

  The findings revealed significant patterns in the speeches, highlighting common strategies and linguistic elements used by different presidents. The clustering further demonstrated how speeches delivered during various historical periods or political contexts were grouped, offering a deeper understanding of the evolution of presidential communication.

  description: |
    Presented the paper "Complexity and Clustering of the US President Speeches" at JADT 2018, held at the University of Tor Vergata, Rome. In collaboration with Prof. Roy Cerqueti and Prof. Marcel Ausloos, this study used text mining and network analysis to examine the complexity and interconnections in US Presidential speeches. The analysis identified a network core of speeches with shared economic language and a periphery of isolated addresses, offering insights into linguistic patterns during economic crises versus stable periods.
